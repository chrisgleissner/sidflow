# PLANS.md — Multi‑hour plans for SIDFlow

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 MD036 MD039 MD051 -->

This file is the long‑lived planning surface for complex or multi‑hour tasks in this repository, following the "Using PLANS.md for multi‑hour problem solving" pattern.

Any LLM agent (Copilot, Cursor, Codex, etc.) working in this repo must:

- Read this file at the start of a substantial task or when resuming work.
- Keep an explicit, checklist‑style plan here for the current task.
- Update the plan and progress sections as work proceeds.
- Record assumptions, decisions, and known gaps so future contributors can continue smoothly.

## How to use this file

For each substantial user request or multi‑step feature, create a new Task section:

```markdown
### Task: <short title> (YYYY-MM-DD)

**User request (summary)**  
- <One or two bullet points>

**Plan (checklist)**  
- [ ] Step 1 — ...

**Progress log**  
- YYYY‑MM‑DD — Started task.  

**Follow‑ups**  
- <Out of scope items>
```

**Guidelines:**
- Prefer small, concrete steps over vague ones.
- Update the checklist as you go.
- When complete, move to `doc/plans/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<task-name>.md`.
- Keep progress logs to last 2-3 days; summarize older entries.

## Maintenance rules

1. **Pruning**: Move completed tasks to archive. Keep progress logs brief.
2. **Structure**: Each task must have: User request, Plan, Progress log, Follow-ups.
3. **Plan-then-act**: Keep checklist synchronized with actual work. Build/Test must pass before marking complete.
4. **TOC**: Regenerate after adding/removing tasks.

## Active tasks

### Task: Classification Pipeline Fixes (2025-12-04)

**Status:** Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE | Phase 2: Future

**User request (summary)**
- Fix bugs preventing Essentia.js from being used by default in classification
- Ensure pipeline follows correct order: render → extract features → classify per SID file

**Analysis Results**

Pipeline flow IS correct - each job in `generateAutoTags` processes sequentially:
1. Check if WAV exists → render if not
2. Extract features with Essentia.js
3. Predict ratings

**Bugs fixed:**
1. **CLI Default Override Bug:** `cli.ts` now passes `undefined` for `featureExtractor`/`predictRatings` when not specified, allowing `generateAutoTags` to use its defaults
2. **generateJsonlOutput Wrong Default:** Now uses `defaultFeatureExtractor` (essentiaFeatureExtractor) instead of `heuristicFeatureExtractor`

**Plan (checklist)**

Phase 1: Fix Essentia.js Defaults ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Step 1.1 — Analyze pipeline flow and identify issues
- [x] Step 1.2 — Fix CLI to not override default feature extractor
- [x] Step 1.3 — Fix generateJsonlOutput to use correct default
- [x] Step 1.4 — Add test to verify CLI passes undefined for featureExtractor
- [x] Step 1.5 — Run tests 3x consecutively (1549 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail × 3)

Phase 2: Web UI Visibility (future)
- [ ] Step 2.1 — Per-thread live status with phase + SID filename
- [ ] Step 2.2 — Counters and stalled indicators in UI
- [ ] Step 2.3 — Structured logging for phase transitions

**Progress log**
- 2025-12-04 — Phase 1 complete. All tests pass 3x consecutively.

**Files changed:**
- `packages/sidflow-classify/src/cli.ts` — Removed hardcoded defaults for featureExtractor/predictRatings
- `packages/sidflow-classify/src/index.ts` — Fixed generateJsonlOutput to use defaultFeatureExtractor
- `packages/sidflow-classify/test/cli.test.ts` — Added test verifying undefined is passed when no module specified

**Follow-ups**
- Add logging to show which feature extractor is being used
- Document pipeline phases more clearly in technical reference

### Task: Codebase Deduplication & Cleanup (2025-12-04)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 4 phases completed, 4 phases assessed (no action needed)

**User request (summary)**
- Review entire codebase for duplication and cleanup opportunities
- Create iterative plan that preserves all existing functionality
- Run all tests after each major refactor step

**Scope:** Code-only cleanup. No feature changes, no behavior changes, no new functionality.

---

#### Phase 1: Remove Stale/Redundant Build Artifacts ✅ ALREADY CLEAN

**Goal:** Remove compiled JS/d.ts files accidentally committed to `src/` directories.

**Result:** No stale files found - directories already contain only .ts source files.

---

#### Phase 2: Remove Empty/Unused Packages ✅ ALREADY CLEAN

**Goal:** Remove packages that have no code.

**Result:** `packages/sidflow-tag/` does not exist. No empty packages found.

---

#### Phase 3: Deduplicate `songlengths.ts` ✅ ALREADY CLEAN

**Problem:** Two implementations were found during planning.

**Result:** Web package already uses `@sidflow/common` exports. Tests in `packages/sidflow-web/tests/unit/songlengths.test.ts` import from `@sidflow/common`. No duplicate exists.

---

#### Phase 4: Consolidate CLI Argument Parsing ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem:** Each CLI package had nearly identical manual arg parsing code.

**Actions completed:**
- [x] Created `packages/sidflow-common/src/cli-parser.ts` with:
  - `ArgDef` interface for defining arguments (name, alias, type, constraints, description)
  - `parseArgs(argv, defs)` generic parser function with support for string, integer, float, boolean types
  - `formatHelp(defs, usage, examples)` for generating help text
  - `handleParseResult()` helper for standard error/help handling
- [x] Added comprehensive tests (29 tests) in `cli-parser.test.ts`
- [x] Migrated `sidflow-fetch` CLI
- [x] Migrated `sidflow-rate` CLI
- [x] Migrated `sidflow-train` CLI
- [x] Migrated `sidflow-play` CLI

**Not migrated (deferred):**
- `sidflow-classify` CLI - Complex with many module-loading options
- `sidflow-classify/render` CLI - Complex with multiple positional arguments

**Validation:** All tests pass (1579 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail) × 3 consecutive runs.

---

#### Phase 5: Consolidate Retry Logic ⏸️ ASSESSED — NO ACTION NEEDED

**Analysis:** The retry implementations serve fundamentally different purposes:
- `@sidflow/common/retry.ts` — Simple generic retry (31 lines)
- `classify/state-machine.ts` — Domain-specific with phase configs, error classification, backoff
- `performance/runner.ts` — Command execution specific with different semantics

**Decision:** Keep separate. Consolidation would introduce coupling and risk regressions.

---

#### Phase 6: Consolidate Type Definitions ⏸️ ASSESSED — NO ACTION NEEDED

**Analysis:** The "duplicate" types have intentionally different field names:
- `classify/SidMetadata`: `{ title, author, released }` — matches SID file header
- `web/lib/SidMetadata`: `{ title, artist, year }` — UI-friendly display names
- `@sidflow/common/SidFileMetadata` — comprehensive type for parsing

**Decision:** Keep separate. These serve different contexts and consolidation would break semantic clarity.

---

#### Phase 7: API Route Refactoring ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Analysis:** 30+ API routes with varying complexity (37-500+ lines). Extensive refactoring would risk regressions.

**Decision:** Defer to future work. Current routes work correctly.

---

#### Phase 8: Test Utility Consolidation ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Analysis:** Would require touching many test files across packages.

**Decision:** Defer to future work. Current tests are comprehensive and passing.

---

#### Phase 9: Final Validation ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Full test suite 3× consecutive passes: **1579 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail** × 3
- [x] Build verification: `bun run build` passes
- [x] E2E tests: 91 pass, 21 fail (pre-existing failures unrelated to this cleanup)

**Net effect:** +404 lines (new cli-parser + tests), -197 lines (CLI simplifications) = +207 lines total, but 4 CLIs now share consistent parsing.

**Progress log**
- 2025-12-04 — Created cleanup plan based on comprehensive codebase review.
- 2025-12-04 — Completed Phase 4: CLI parser consolidation. Tests pass 3× consecutively.
- 2025-12-04 — Assessed Phases 5-8: No action needed or deferred due to risk.

**Follow-ups (out of scope)**
- Migrate sidflow-classify CLIs to shared parser (complex argument handling)
- Performance optimizations
- API route standardization (when resources allow)
