# PLANS.md - SID Classification Pipeline Recovery

## Objective

Recover the SID classification pipeline by diagnosing and fixing the pathological behavior where `GAMES/S-Z/Super_Mario_Bros_64_2SID.sid` causes all workers to become stuck, pegging all cores at 100% with zero forward progress.

## Branch Topology

- `main`: restored to `c392f08` (stable baseline)
- `fix/direct-sid-classification`: contains commits `e6ea3b4..e06e301` + new fix work

## Phase 0 - Branch Recovery and Plan
- [x] Create `fix/direct-sid-classification` at `e06e301`
- [x] Reset `main` to `c392f08`
- [x] Verify branch topology
- [x] Create PLANS.md
- [x] Create WORKLOG.md

## Phase 1 - Establish Baseline
- [ ] Confirm pipeline builds and tests pass on fix branch
- [ ] Run small bounded classification (5-10 SIDs) to confirm non-pathological behavior
- [ ] Define reproduction tiers (single SID, small batch, prefix replay)
- [ ] Define forward-progress metrics

## Phase 2 - Telemetry Instrumentation
- [ ] Add per-song wall-clock timeout to `runConcurrent` worker invocations
- [ ] Add per-worker SID attribution logging (JSON)
- [ ] Add stall watchdog: no song completes for 60s -> dump state
- [ ] Add duplicate-dispatch detection (same SID on multiple workers)
- [ ] Add periodic status snapshot (every 10s) with queue/worker state
- [ ] Add per-song timing and outcome tracking
- [ ] Machine-readable run summary JSON

## Phase 3 - Controlled Reproduction
- [ ] Tier A: Single-SID isolation of `Super_Mario_Bros_64_2SID.sid`
- [ ] Tier B: Small batch (5-10 SIDs) including the problematic SID
- [ ] Tier C: Prefix replay approaching historical failure
- [ ] Determine minimal reproduction scope

## Phase 4 - Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Identify exact stage where problematic SID stalls
- [ ] Determine if single worker hangs vs multiple workers stuck on same SID
- [ ] Determine if duplicate dispatch occurs
- [ ] Compare normal vs pathological SID telemetry
- [ ] State root cause precisely

## Phase 5 - Implement Fixes
- [ ] Per-song watchdog timeout with error attribution
- [ ] Worker ownership discipline (one SID cannot monopolize all workers)
- [ ] Deduplication/lease protection against duplicate concurrent dispatch
- [ ] Forward-progress detection
- [ ] Safe failure: pathological SID skipped/quarantined, pipeline continues
- [ ] Structured failure artifacts

## Phase 6 - CPU Utilization Stabilization
- [ ] Measure utilization during healthy runs
- [ ] Identify idle gaps or bottlenecks
- [ ] Verify >= 50% avg CPU per core during substantial runs
- [ ] No false 100% CPU with zero progress

## Phase 7 - Long-Run Validation
- [ ] Bounded run crossing historical ~10 min failure threshold
- [ ] Large corpus run with continuous progress
- [ ] All expected output artifacts produced
- [ ] Telemetry confirms worker health throughout

## Phase 8 - Regression Protection
- [ ] Regression test for pathological-song timeout behavior
- [ ] Scheduler test: duplicate SID ownership cannot consume all workers
- [ ] Timeout/watchdog test
- [ ] Documented reproduction procedure

## Phase 9 - Final Documentation
- [ ] Root-cause write-up in doc/research/
- [ ] Updated classification usage docs
- [ ] Telemetry inspection guide
- [ ] Final verification evidence in WORKLOG.md
