# WORKLOG.md - SID Classification Pipeline Recovery

## 2026-03-24T00:00Z — Phase 0: Branch Recovery

### Actions
- Created branch `fix/direct-sid-classification` at `e06e301` (8 commits after `c392f08`)
- Reset `main` to `c392f08`
- Switched to `fix/direct-sid-classification`

### Branch topology verified
```
main:     c392f08 feat: add system ROMs requirements and alternative locations to README
fix/...:  e06e301 feat: enable SID register-write trace capture during WAV rendering
          includes e6ea3b4..e06e301 (8 commits)
```

### Key architectural findings from code review
1. `runConcurrent()` (index.ts:236) uses work-stealing queue — each worker grabs next item atomically
2. **NO per-song timeout**: if WASM render hangs, the Promise never resolves, worker blocked forever
3. `WasmRendererPool` (wasm-render-pool.ts) has no per-job timeout either
4. Heartbeats are emitted but **nobody acts on stale detection** — purely for UI display
5. `Super_Mario_Bros_64_2SID.sid`: PSID v3, 1 song, 7054 bytes, uses 2 SID chips
6. 61,275 SID files in HVSC corpus
7. Retry logic exists (`withRetry`) but only for caught errors — infinite hang bypasses it entirely
8. No deduplication: multi-song SIDs produce one queue entry per sub-song

### Root cause hypothesis
The most likely failure mode is: WASM render of `Super_Mario_Bros_64_2SID.sid` either runs forever (infinite loop in emulation) or takes pathologically long, and because there is NO per-song timeout, the worker Promise never resolves. As workers complete their other songs and try to grab the next item, they drain the queue — but the stuck worker(s) never finish. Eventually all workers are idle-waiting-for-queue-empty via `Promise.all(runners)` while the stuck worker holds the last item(s). This manifests as 100% CPU on the stuck worker thread(s) with no forward progress.
