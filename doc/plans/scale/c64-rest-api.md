# C64 REST API Reference

This document is a concise version of the official [Ultimate REST API guide](https://1541u-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api_calls.html).

## HTTP Basics

- REST access starts from Ultimate firmware 3.11.
- URLs follow the form `/v1/{route}/{path}:{command}?{arguments}`.

| Verb | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| GET | Retrieves information without changing state. |
| PUT | Sends information or performs an action using the information in the URL or in a referenced file. |
| POST | Performs an action using information attached to the request. |

- Responses normally use `Content-Type: application/json` and always include an `errors` array.
- Firmware 3.12 introduces the optional Network Password. When it is set, include `X-Password: {your-password}` in every request. The firmware returns `403 Forbidden` when the header is missing or incorrect. Supplying the header on an unsecured unit is accepted and ignored.

## Routes

The sections below follow the order and wording of the RST reference.

## Render Workflow Reference

SIDFlow render jobs use the REST API plus the Ultimate 64 audio stream to capture real hardware output. The high-level sequence for each SID file is:

1. **Configure + start stream** – `PUT /v1/streams/audio:start?ip={host}:{port}` to direct the audio stream to the capture host. The CLI derives the host/port from `.sidflow.json` (`render.ultimate64.streamIp` and `render.ultimate64.audioPort`).
2. **Begin UDP capture** – `Ultimate64AudioCapture` binds to the configured UDP port, enqueues packets, and monitors sequence numbers/loss. Packet reordering and silence filling follow the `doc/plans/scale/c64-stream-spec.md` rules. Capture stops automatically after the configured duration plus a 1s grace period.
3. **Select SID chip + play** – `PUT /v1/configs/sid%20sockets%20configuration/sid%20in%20socket%201` sets the chip profile (`6581` or `8580R5`), then `POST /v1/runners:sidplay?songnr={n}` uploads and starts the SID file. The CLI injects the song buffer directly; no file system staging is required.
4. **Stop stream + transcode** – once capture reports a loss rate below the configured threshold, the job stops the audio stream via `PUT /v1/streams/audio:stop`, converts PCM samples to a 44.1 kHz WAV, and optionally encodes M4A/FLAC outputs.

The `scripts/sidflow-render` CLI now orchestrates these steps automatically. It will try the requested engine order (Ultimate 64, `sidplayfp`, WASM) and surface detailed availability reasons for each fallback. See `packages/sidflow-classify/src/render/cli.ts` for the exact option set (formats, duration, loss threshold, preferred engines).
